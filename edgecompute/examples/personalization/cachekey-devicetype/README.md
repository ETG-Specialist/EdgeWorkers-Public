Examples here includes the device type (tablet or mobile or custom categorization) from a PMUSER variable in the computed cache key for an Edge Server. Variations of this logic use EdgeKV as well

## Subfolder organization
* **/cachekey-devicetype**: Add client device type into cache key to enable device-specific content caching without changing URL
* **/customer-girnar-software-example**: Classifies client device using custom User-Agent match and adds it to cache-key along with version information fetched from EdgeKV
